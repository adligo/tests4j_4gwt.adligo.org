This project contains the tests4j gwt framework,
which compiles into javascript so you can run 
java script tests in a 
java script test framework
for javascript code generated from GWT

This allows you to actually write tests
that run in JSE and java script
WITHOUT rewriting the test (if you do it right).

It also allows you to write tests vs the views
and other GWT code that is client specific.
